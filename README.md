# Prediction-of-abnormal-e-commerce-orders

This project is an abnormal forecast for some of the e-commerce transaction data of a Fortune 500 company in China in 2013. The case data comes from non-masked data from a Fortune 500 company. It was first disclosed on Gitee in 2018. It is real data from the company with business information. This data discloses the strategic deployment and business logic of a Fortune 500 company in the field of e-commerce, as well as the achievements in 2013, from which we can slightly restore the competition situation in the field of e-commerce when the e-commerce war arose. For any online shopping platform, one of the key responsibilities of the platform is to accurately judge the purchase intention behind each order, and protect the rights and interests of buyers based on this. Sellers bring a better trading experience. Therefore, it is important to quickly perform anomaly detection (risk assessment) on the transaction after the transaction is completed. In this case, we will use part of the transaction data of the e-commerce platform in 2013 to model, and realize the identification and detection of abnormal orders.
